  exerciseDescription: The bench press is a fundamental upper-body exercise that
    targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Lie flat on a bench with feet planted,
    grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width, and keep wrists straight. Lower
    the bar to mid-chest, keeping elbows at a 45-degree angle. Press up explosively,
    fully extending arms without locking out. Maintain tight core engagement and
    controlled movement throughout. Always use a spotter or safety bars for heavy
    lifts. Proper form and progressive overload are key to strength gains while minimizing
    injury risk.
