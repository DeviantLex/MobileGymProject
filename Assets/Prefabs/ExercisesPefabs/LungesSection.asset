  exerciseDescription: Lunges are a lower-body exercise that strengthens the quads,
    glutes, and hamstrings while improving balance and stability. Start standing
    with feet hip-width apart. Step forward with one leg, lowering your hips until
    both knees form 90-degree angles. Keep your front knee aligned with your ankle
    and your torso upright. Push through your front heel to return to the starting
    position. Repeat on the other leg. Perform lunges with body weight or added resistance
    like dumbbells. Maintain controlled movement and avoid letting your back knee
    slam into the ground. Proper form ensures effectiveness and reduces injury risk.
