  exerciseDescription: The bicep curl is an isolation exercise that strengthens the
    biceps. Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding dumbbells or a barbell with
    an underhand grip. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your wrists straight.
    Curl the weight upward by contracting your biceps, bringing it toward shoulder
    level without swinging or using momentum. Lower it slowly under control to the
    starting position. Keep your core engaged and avoid excessive shoulder movement.
    Proper form ensures maximum muscle activation and reduces injury risk. Start
    with a manageable weight and focus on controlled, full-range motion for optimal
    results.
