  exerciseDescription: The Arnold press is a shoulder exercise that targets all three
    deltoid heads for balanced development. Start seated or standing with dumbbells
    at shoulder height, palms facing you. As you press up, rotate your palms outward
    until they face forward at full extension. Lower the weights back to the starting
    position, reversing the motion. Maintain a controlled tempo, keep your core engaged,
    and avoid using momentum. This movement increases shoulder mobility and strength
    while reducing joint stress compared to a standard overhead press. Use a manageable
    weight to ensure proper form and prevent injury.
