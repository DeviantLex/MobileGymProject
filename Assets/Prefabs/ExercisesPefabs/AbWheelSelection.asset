  exerciseDescription: The ab wheel is an advanced core exercise that targets the
    abs, obliques, and stabilizing muscles. Start on your knees, gripping the wheel
    handles firmly. Engage your core, keeping a neutral spine, and slowly roll forward,
    extending your body while maintaining control. Avoid arching your lower back.
    Roll out as far as you can while maintaining tension, then engage your abs to
    pull yourself back to the starting position. Start with short ranges and progress
    as strength improves. Proper control and core engagement are essential to prevent
    strain and maximize effectiveness.
