  exerciseDescription: The pull-up is a bodyweight exercise that builds upper-body
    strength, targeting the back, biceps, and core. Grip a pull-up bar with hands
    slightly wider than shoulder-width, palms facing away. Engage your core and retract
    your shoulder blades. Pull your chest toward the bar by driving your elbows down,
    keeping movement controlled. Lower yourself slowly until arms are fully extended.
    Avoid swinging or using momentum. If full pull-ups are difficult, start with
    assisted variations or negatives. Consistent practice improves strength, posture,
    and muscle endurance. Proper form is key to maximizing benefits and preventing
    injury.
