  exerciseDescription: The back extension strengthens the lower back, glutes, and
    hamstrings. Position yourself on a back extension bench with hips just above
    the pad and feet secured. Cross your arms over your chest or hold a weight for
    added resistance. Engage your core and slowly lower your torso until you feel
    a stretch in your lower back. Squeeze your glutes and lift back to the starting
    position without hyperextending. Keep movements controlled and avoid excessive
    arching to prevent strain. This exercise improves posture, spinal stability,
    and lower back strength, making it essential for injury prevention and overall
    core development.
