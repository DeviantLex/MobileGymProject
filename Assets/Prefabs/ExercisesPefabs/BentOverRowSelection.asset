  exerciseDescription: The bent-over row is a compound exercise that targets the
    upper back, lats, and biceps. Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a barbell
    or dumbbells with an overhand grip. Hinge at the hips, keeping your back straight
    and chest up, until your torso is nearly parallel to the floor. Pull the weight
    toward your lower ribcage by driving your elbows back, squeezing your shoulder
    blades together. Lower the weight with control. Avoid rounding your back or using
    momentum. This movement builds strength, improves posture, and enhances pulling
    power for other lifts. Use proper form to prevent strain or injury.
