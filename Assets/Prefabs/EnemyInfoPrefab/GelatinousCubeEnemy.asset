  MonsterDescription: ' A massive, nearly invisible cube of acidic jelly that slowly
    creeps through dungeons, dissolving everything in its path. Anything that touches
    it gets engulfed and slowly digested. Despite their mindless nature, these creatures
    serve as effective dungeon custodians, cleaning up organic debris.'
