  MonsterDescription: A terrifying floating orb covered in eyestalks, each capable
    of firing deadly magical rays. The central eye negates magic, while the other
    stalks can unleash effects like disintegration, petrification, or sleep. Beholders
    are highly intelligent, paranoid, and often believe they are superior to all
    other beings.
